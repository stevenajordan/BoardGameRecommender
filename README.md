README

This is the board game recommender system built by Steven Jordan as a final project to DSC 478.
To initiate the system, please run BG_Recommender_Start.py in your favorite shell, or in the
Command Window, change to this directory and input 'python BG_Recommender_Start.py'

Use the URLs from www.boardgamegeek.com (navigate via https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) when prompted. 
Of the top 4999 board games, 4575 were used in the system, so you can also select URLs from the acceptable_urls.txt file
as inputs.
